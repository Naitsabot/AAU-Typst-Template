# AAU Typst Template (Naitsa)
AAU report template written in typst

## Quick-start guide for online usage

Manually copy the following into the Typst Online App:
- `single_file_template.typ` *and rename it to `template.typ`* (for convenience)
- `main.typ` (so you don’t have to fiddle)
- `sources.bib` to hold your citations
- `assets/` — copy all contents of the local `assets` folder into a folder of the same name (`assets`). Contains:
  - `appendix.typ` (for appendices)
  - `AAU/` folder containing all AAU assets used in the template
