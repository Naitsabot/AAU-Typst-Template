#import "//template.typ": * // Import of all templating content

= Introduction
Getting started with Typst shouldn't be that difficult. The language is pretty similar to JavaScript #footnote([A programming language which is known for its incredible type system!]). It is also pretty similar to writing in Markdown.

This showcase is meant as a guide in some basic typst functionallity. Have the Typst file (editor) open togehter with the generated document (preview) to see how things work.

== Getting Started
You can start by modifying this template, or using the empty report template.

=== Write Typst Collaboratively
You can use #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst.app] to write collaboratively. Just download #link("https://github.com/krestenlaust/AAU-Typst-Template/")[this project] as zip, and upload either template to the empty typst project:

 - main.typ
 - template.typ
 - (folder) AAUgraphics
 - (folder) chapters
 - (folder) sources
